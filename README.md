# AI and the Music Ecosystem: Enhancing Creativity or Diminishing Artistry?

This repository contains my final essay for the course **New Perspectives in Management and Entrepreneurship Theory** (Landscape MA). The paper critically explores how artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the traditional music production process — from creation to distribution and live performance.

## Summary

The essay analyzes the role of AI across:
- Music creation and composition (e.g., tools like Amper Music, LANDR)
- Marketing and recommendation systems (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music)
- Ethical and legal challenges (e.g., copyright issues in AI training)
- Live performance and emotional authenticity

It argues that while AI can greatly enhance efficiency and innovation, it also challenges artistic identity, emotional depth, and legal boundaries.
